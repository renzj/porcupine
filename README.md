# porcupine
Porcupine is designed for benchmarking various cloud file systems. Unlike previous file system benchmarks. Porcupine can generate customized file I/O requests, which could be rather heterogeneous and complex. The workload can be generated by sample trace replay or synthesized with a set of workload configurations, such as the composition of request types (sequential/random read/write, etc) and the pattern of request arrival rate.
