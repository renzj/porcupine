
this is a benchmark for measuring the isolation of cloud file system such as CephFS,HDFS and so on.If you want to use it. You should read the following instructions.

1. requirements:
	MySQL(more than 5.6 versions),
	Python 2.7
	lxml-python
	MySQLdb for python

2.You need two or three nodes,better for more, to run this benchmark.You know,it needs a very high query for the cloud file system .So it better to choose one or more nodes for each tenant.

3.Before you want to run it,you should install Python 2.7,lxml,MySQLdb, MySQL and create some tables. then you should edit the cfbench.json file in the cfbench directory.The cfbench.json is a config about how to generate the workloads,e,g:total_generate_times,number_of_request,threads_per_time,requests_per_thread.There is a example json file which can tell you how to use it.Finally you run python main.py in every tenant client.The log files and benchmark results are respectively in the /home/cfbench-log/ directory and mysql tables. You will know the isolation of system from above.Hope you enjoy it!
